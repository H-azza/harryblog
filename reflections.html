            Git is a software that either you can use by yourself to help keep version of your code backed up in a repository where you can create iterations of the code you have been working on. If it breaks you can revert back to an older version to when it worked and continue and try again. If you were to get any help though someone could come along and see your code in your repository and pull it from there and work on it as well in their own local repository to help and then could re-merge it again when they fixed the code you couldn’t figure out. <br>
            <br>
            Git mainly shines through when working in large teams that have different groups of people working on different parts of the code for a single product/final goal. For example, in a game you could have groups on UI, Gameplay, and Engine. Each person working on the game would have their own repository to be able to save the code their working on. Once you have finished the code you have been working on it will be possible to combine your code and repository with someone else’s to bring it all together. This is really useful because it can mean one person that’s better at certain tasks can focus on that while the other coder might be better at something else. <br>
            <br>
            Together these coders could be working on a separate feature that will eventually go into the master branch/final code. The branching feature is super important because you can work on something big or small and keep all of the changes separate from that master line of code. Then when complete you can merge the feature into the master code and have it ready to be published. Because we have all iterations made by all the coders in a team if anything was to break you have a full history to go back on and you can fix the code and then re-commit it.
